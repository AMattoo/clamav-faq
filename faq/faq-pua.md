## Potentially Unwanted Applications ##

<strong>PUA - Possibly Unwanted Applications</strong>

ClamAV supports the detection of so called PUAs. At the moment the
following categories are available:

<em>Packed</em>

This is a detection for files that use some kind of runtime packer. A
runtime packer  can be used to reduce the size of executable files
without the need for an external unpacker. While this canâ€˜t be
considered malicious in general, runtime packers are widely used with
malicious files since they can prevent a already known malware from
detection by an Antivirus product.

<em>PwTool</em>

Password tools are all applications that can be used to recover or
decrypt passwords for various applications - like mail clients or
system passwords. Such tools can be quite helpful if a password is
lost, however, it can also be used to spy out passwords.

<em>NetTool</em>

Applications that can be used to sniff, filter, manipulate or scan
network traffic or networks.  While a networkscanner - for example -
can be a extremely helpful tool for admins, you may not want to see an
average user playing arround with it. Same goes for tools like netcat
and the like.

<em>P2P</em>

Peer to Peer clients can be used to generate a lot of unwanted traffic
and sometimes it happens that copyrights are violated by downloading
copyright protected content (Music, Movies) - therefore we consider
them possibly unwanted as well.

<em>IRC</em>

IRC Clients can be a productivity killer and depending on the client -
a powerful platform for malicious scripts (take mIRC for example).

<em>RAT</em>
Remote Access Trojans are used to remotely access systems, but can be used also by system admins, for example VNC or RAdmin

<em>Tool</em>
General system tools, like process killers/finders

<em>Spy</em>
Keyloggers, spying tools

<em>Server</em>
Server based badware like DistributedNet

<em>Script</em>
Known "problem" scripts written in Javascript, ActiveX or similar.
