## Using the ClamAV mailing lists ##

* Where can I ask questions about using ClamAV?

>Subscribe to our [clamav-users](http://lists.clamav.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/clamav-users) mailing-list.

* I want to take part to the development of ClamAV. Where can I get more info?

>Subscribe to the [clamav-devel](http://lists.clamav.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/clamav-devel) mailing-list.

* The mailing-lists generate too many messages per day. I can't handle them. What shall I do?

>There are two possible solutions: 	- Go to the [mailing-list](http://lists.clamav.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo) mailman interface, click on __Unsubscribe or edit options__, and turn _digest mode_ on 	- access the mailing-lists using a "news reader"

* I sent a message to one of ClamAV's mailing-lists, but the mail was rejected/held for approval. Why?

>Only subscribers are allowed to post to the mailing-list. This is done to avoid spammers. Please check that your outgoing messages start with a line like the following: <code>Return-Path: me@mydomain.com</code> where <code>me@mydomain.com</code> is the mail account which you used to subscribe to the mailing-list. You can subscribe multiple times, with different mail addresses, and  disable mail delivery. You will be able to post to the mailing-lists by putting any of those addresses in <code>Return-Path</code>.

* I read the mailing-list from the Gmane news gateway. Can I post to the mailing-list?

>See previous FAQ.

* I've been unsubscribed from one of the mailing-lists. What happened?

>There are two possible reasons: If your account generates too many bounces you'll be automatically unsubscribed.  Please subscribe again with a more reliable account. If we receive even one _out of office notification_ from your vacation program,  your address will be unsubscribed and banned from our mailing-lists forever.  Sorry for that, there are just too many stupid people out there.

* How do I disable mail delivery from the mailing-list I'm subscribed to?

>Suppose you are subscribed to clamav-users. Go to http://lists.clamav.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/clamav-users and enter your mail address at the bottom of the page. Click on __Unsubscribe or edit options__. At the next page enter your password and press _Log in_. Under _Your clamav-users Subscription Options_ choose _Disabled_ opposite _Mail delivery_ and press _Submit My Changes_ at the bottom of the page.
